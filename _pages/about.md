I am a third year Mathematic PhD student at the University of St Andrews, supported by the Chinese Scholarship Council. My research area is ergodic theory and dynamical systems, in particular, thermodynamic formalisms of countable-state symbolic systems and interval maps. I am primarily supervised by [Prof Mike Todd](https://mtoddm.github.io/). You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf). <br>
