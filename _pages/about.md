I am a third year Mathematic PhD student at the University of St Andrews, UK. My research area is ergodic theory and dynamical systems, in particular, thermodynamic formalism of countable state symbolic system and interval maps. I am primarily supervised by [Prof Mike Todd](https://mtoddm.github.io/). You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf) I am supported by the Chinese Scholarship Council. <br>
I completed my BSc Mathematics with Modern languages at University College London in 2020 and MSc Mathematics at University of St Andrews 2021.
