I am a third year Mathematic PhD student at the University of St Andrews, supported by the Chinese Scholarship Council programme. My research area is **ergodic theory and dynamical systems**, in particular, thermodynamic formalisms of countable-state symbolic systems and interval maps and some of their statistical properties. I am supervised by [Mike Todd](https://mtoddm.github.io/) and [Kenneth Falconer](https://kennethfalconer.github.io/). You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf). <br>
